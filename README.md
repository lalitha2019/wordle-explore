# wordle-explore
An exercise in python, to become comfortable with dataframes, finding patterns in wordle words.

**Objective:** To become comfortable with Python syntax, and to have some fun

**Task:** To explore patterns of letter placing in wordle

**Data:** List of words I solved over a period of more than two months. Currently, there are 68 words

**Known bug:** Letters in first place are not being counted. This is because when I saved words they all started with capital letters.

**Unknowns:** There could be mistakes as I tested quickly and not exhaustively.

**Goals for improvement:** Improvement goals: tidying up, adding a few summary explorations from earlier versions, adding case insensitivty

**Goals for Enhancement:** to capture additions and explore possibilites of predictions

**Time taken:** 6 to 8 hours today over a period of 2 days (3rd and 4th Nov. 2022)

 ## Files:
  * wordle-words - spreadsheet - has the collection of wordle words used in this project. Also, split the word into letters, to help test the results of this project.
  * wordle-explore-6.py - python code - includes notes about what I am learning along the way.
  * wordle_graph.png - graph showing the patterns for lette placement in wordle results
