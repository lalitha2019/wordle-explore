# wordle-explore
An exercise in python, to become comfortable with dataframes, finding patterns in wordle words.
Objective: To become comfortable with Python syntax, and to have some fun
Task: To explore patterns of letter placing in wordle
Data: List of word I solved in last 70 days or so. Missed noting a couple of them. So, there are 68 words
Known bug: Letters in first place are not being counted.This is because when I saved words they all started with #Capital letter.
Unknowns: There could be mistakes as I tested quickly and not exhaustively
Goals for improvemnt: Improvement goals: tidying up, adding a few summary explorations from earlier versions, adding case insensitivty
Goals for Enhancement: to capture additions and explore possibilites of predictions
Time taken: 6 to 8 hours today over a period of 2 days (3rd and 4th Nov. 2022)

Files:
wordle-words - spreadsheet - has the collection of wordle words used in this project. Also, split the word into letters, to help test the results of this project.
wordle-explore-6.py - python code - includes notes about what I am learning along the way.
wordle_graph.png - graph showing the patterns for lette placement in wordle results
